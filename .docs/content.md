### Writing Guidelines

#### **Do's:**

✅ **Be Specific and Concrete**

- Instead of: "I help people with problems"
- Write: "I help professionals overcome anxiety and chronic procrastination through evidence-based online hypnotherapy"

✅ **Lead with Benefits, Not Features**

- Instead of: "I offer 60-minute online sessions"
- Write: "In our focused 60-minute online sessions, you'll develop the tools to manage anxiety and boost productivity"

✅ **Use Active Voice**

- Instead of: "Procrastination can be addressed through hypnotherapy"
- Write: "Hypnotherapy addresses the root causes of procrastination"

✅ **Show Credentials Naturally**

- Instead of: "I am a certified hypnotherapist with 15 years experience"
- Write: "With 15 years of experience as a certified hypnotherapist, I've helped hundreds of clients..."

✅ **Acknowledge Online Format Proactively**

- "Online sessions provide the same effectiveness as in-person therapy, with added convenience"
- "From the comfort of your home, you'll experience professional hypnotherapy"

---

#### **Don'ts:**

❌ **Avoid Unrealistic Promises**

- Don't: "Cure your anxiety in one session"
- Don't: "100% guaranteed results"

❌ **Don't Use Medical Claims**

- Don't: "Treat depression" (unless licensed to do so)
- Don't: "Cure" or "heal" mental health conditions
- Don't: Position as replacement for medical treatment

❌ **Avoid Mysticism or Pseudoscience**

- Don't: "Unlock your chakras"
- Don't: "Quantum healing"
- Don't: Overly esoteric language that undermines professionalism

❌ **Don't Be Overly Technical**

- Don't: "Utilize neuroplastic modalities for cognitive restructuring"
- Do: "Help your brain create new, healthier thought patterns"

❌ **Avoid Negative Framing**

- Don't: "Tired of failing at..."
- Do: "Ready to finally overcome..."

### Vocabulary Guide

**Preferred Terms:**

- Session (not "appointment" or "treatment")
- Consultation (for initial contact)
- Challenges or struggles (not "problems" or "issues")
- Evidence-based (emphasize throughout)
- Professional (self-description)

**Words to Use Sparingly:**

- Transformation (overused in wellness industry)

- Holistic (can sound pseudoscientific)
- Healing (medical connotation, use carefully)

**Words to Avoid:**

- Fix (implies broken)
- Cure (medical claim)
- Guaranteed (unrealistic)
- Always/Never (too absolute)
- Easy/Effortless (undermines work required)

---

### Grammar and Style Preferences

**Formatting:**

- **Headers:** Sentence case (not Title Case)
- **Lists:** Sentence fragments OK in bulleted lists, full sentences in numbered lists
- **Emphasis:** Use bold for key concepts, italics sparingly
- **Numbers:** Spell out one through nine, use numerals for 10+
- **Acronyms:** Define on first use, then use acronym (e.g., "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)")

**Punctuation:**

- **Oxford Comma:** Yes, always use
- **Dashes:** Use em dashes (—) without spaces, en dashes (–) for ranges
- **Ellipses:** Avoid in professional content (use em dash instead)

**Person:**

- First person singular: "I" when Tetiana is speaking
- Second person: "You" when addressing potential clients
- Third person: Avoid (too formal for therapy context)

I struggled with work-related anxiety for years, trying various approaches with limited success. Working with Tetiana through online sessions was incredibly effective. She helped me understand the root causes of my anxiety and gave me practical tools I use daily.

What surprised me most was how comfortable and effective the online format was—I could do sessions from my home during lunch breaks. Within six weeks, I felt more in control and confident in challenging work situations. I highly recommend Tetiana's online hypnotherapy services.

### Editing Guidelines

**When to Edit:**

- Grammar and spelling corrections (always)
- Overly long testimonials (condense to 150 words max)
- Unclear or vague language (clarify with client approval)
- Remove identifying details (last names, specific locations, employers)

**When NOT to Edit:**

- Don't change the core message or sentiment
- Don't add claims the client didn't make
- Don't combine multiple clients into one testimonial
- Don't fabricate or embellish details

**Always get client approval on final edited version.**

---

### Incentivization (Optional)

**Ethical Considerations:**

- ❌ Don't pay for testimonials (violates trust and may be illegal)
- ❌ Don't offer discounts in exchange for positive reviews
- ✅ Can offer small thank-you gift after publication (not before)
  - Example: $10 Amazon gift card, donation to charity of their choice
  - Must be offered after testimonial is written, not as incentive

**Best Practice:** Make providing testimonials easy and appreciated, not transactional.

---

### Display Strategy

**Homepage:**

- Feature 3 rotating testimonials (1 per service area)
- Choose most compelling and diverse
- Include ratings and client identifiers

**Services Pages:**

- Display 2-3 service-specific testimonials per page
- Match testimonial to service being described

**Dedicated Testimonials Page (optional):**

- Display all approved testimonials
- Filter by service type
- Include longer-form case studies if available

**Social Proof Integration:**

- Subtle testimonial excerpts in CTAs
- Quote highlights in hero sections
- Star ratings aggregated (if sufficient quantity)

---
